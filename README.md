## What is this?

Because the WeakAuras Team set a limitation on WeakAuras API access from version 5.8.1, applying custom code to WeakAuras is no longer possible. The shadowed ElvUI-style WeakAuras skin from my other work, [ElvUI_WindTools](https://github.com/fang2hou/ElvUI_WindTools), stopped working. Therefore, I decided to patch WeakAuras myself, and here it is.

## What is patched?

- Allow all WeakAuras APIs to be accessed by external code.

Currently, only the WeakAuras APIs are patched. The ElvUI-style skin is not included in this addon. To use the skin, download it separately from [ElvUI_WindTools](https://github.com/fang2hou/ElvUI_WindTools) and install it as an additional addon.
