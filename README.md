## What is this?

Because WeakAuras Team set the limitation of WeakAuras API access from 5.8.1, there is no way to apply custom code to WeakAuras. The shadowed ElvUI-style WeakAuras skin from my other work [ElvUI_WindTools](https://github.com/fang2hou/ElvUI_WindTools) is not working anymore. So I decided to patch the WeakAuras by myself, and here it is.

## What is patched?

- Set all WeakAuras API can be accessed by external code.

Currently, only the WeakAuras API is patched. The ElvUI-style skin is not included in this addon. You can download it from [ElvUI_WindTools](https://github.com/fang2hou/ElvUI_WindTools) and install it as a separate addon.
